# Preparing and publishing a release

Panoptos has one unrestricted GPL-3.0-or-later app. GitHub, Homebrew, and optional
Gumroad delivery use the same official signed/notarized DMG. Preparation does
not authorize publication.

## Source and branch policy

The canonical application repository is `RUverse/panoptos-mac`. For the first public
release, use a sanitized export with new history, preserving the original private
repository separately. Do not push legacy GitLab history, backup refs, local
signing configuration, private operations files, or build output. Base topic
branches on `dev` and submit development PRs to `dev`. Reserve PRs targeting
`main` for release promotions from `dev`. Scan the exact proposed tree and
history before its first push.

“Prepare release” runs candidate checks and stages review material without
merging or publishing. An instruction to release also authorizes creating and
merging the release PR from `dev` to `main` after the required checks pass; no
separate merge confirmation is needed. Merge the promotion with a merge commit,
never squash or rebase, so `main` keeps `dev`'s history. Review the exact `dev`
commit being promoted, and repeat review and validation if it changes. Build,
validate, sign, and tag the final release from the resulting exact `main`
commit. The official artifacts and corresponding source must all match that
commit.

Keep the website in its existing repository and hosting setup. Its deployment
is a separate publication action. The Homebrew tap is `RUverse/homebrew-tap`.

## Version and evidence

Choose a stable `X.Y.Z` greater than the latest published marketing version. Set
both Xcode configurations' `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`;
the new build must exceed both configurations and every published appcast/GitHub
release build. Keep bundle identity, the Sparkle public key, and the appcast URL
unchanged. The first GPL release is **1.4.0, build 11**, following 1.3.3/build 10.

Prepare concise Markdown notes describing observable changes. Keep notes outside
`build/release/`, which packaging recreates. Record the exact source commit and
run the Debug build/full test suite, unsigned Release validation, and clean
contributor build without `Signing.local.xcconfig`. Complete the manual checks
in `AGENTS.md` with Xcode Stop/Run, or record gaps explicitly.

## GitHub Actions preparation

Run **Prepare release candidate** (`release-candidate.yml`) manually on the reviewed commit, supplying
its version, build, `RUverse/panoptos-mac`, and release-note text. The workflow has
read-only permissions and no signing credentials. It does not create tags or
releases, update the live appcast, or deploy the website.

Its candidate artifact contains Debug/full-test and Release validation evidence,
`Panoptos-unsigned.zip`, notes, exact-commit metadata, `appcast-draft.json`,
checksums, and matching source. These are review files, not the public release
asset list. The unsigned app must never be distributed as an official download.
Inspect the workflow log and artifact metadata against the commit you intend to
sign. Never run privileged release steps for untrusted PRs.

## Local signing and packaging

Production signing remains on the maintainer's Mac. Keep the Developer ID
certificate, notary credentials, and Sparkle EdDSA private key local. Configure
the team in ignored `Signing.local.xcconfig`; no license Keychain access group
or provisioning profile is needed. Preserve default certificate-derived
designated requirements, hardened runtime, secure timestamps, nested Sparkle
audits, app/DMG notarization, stapling, and Gatekeeper verification.

From the clean exact source commit:

```sh
scripts/release.sh --dry-run --github-repository RUverse/panoptos-mac
scripts/release.sh --release-notes build/release-notes-1.4.0.md --github-repository RUverse/panoptos-mac
```

The dry run validates local packaging without notarization or publication; its
DMG is not an official release. A normal run uses `Panoptos.md` as the notes
embedded in the Sparkle appcast and prepares `ReleaseNotes.md` as the GitHub
release body, including the GPL/source link and SHA-256 checksums. It prepares
the signed/notarized candidate under `build/release/candidate/vX.Y.Z/` and stages
the appcast in the website checkout. Candidate metadata, `Panoptos.md`,
`ReleaseNotes.md`, `SHA256SUMS`, and `appcast.xml` remain local review or
publication-input files. The script never commits or pushes.

The public GitHub release has an exact two-asset allowlist:

- `Panoptos.dmg`
- `Panoptos-X.Y.Z-source.tar.gz`

Publish the contents of `ReleaseNotes.md` as the release description. Put both
asset checksums in that description; do not upload a checksum file, notes file,
appcast, candidate metadata, unsigned build, logs, or result bundle as an asset.

The corresponding-source archive contains the exact app commit, Xcode project,
resources, build/packaging scripts, notices, and source for the pinned Sparkle
dependency, including required non-system dependency source. The automatic
GitHub repository archive alone does not include SPM dependency source.

```sh
scripts/package-source.sh --version 1.4.0 --build 11 --output build/source-review
```

Verify the archive contents and build instructions. Do not include secrets.
Keep GPL and Sparkle notices in the app and release source. Each binary must link
to its version's matching source, rather than only a moving default branch.

## Homebrew preparation

After final signed/notarized DMG bytes exist, generate a local cask:

```sh
scripts/prepare-cask.py --version 1.4.0 --dmg build/release/candidate/v1.4.0/Panoptos.dmg --output /path/to/homebrew-tap/Casks/panoptos.rb
```

Review the version, GitHub URL, and computed SHA-256. Run Homebrew style/audit
checks. Normal uninstall removes the app and preserves preferences/workspaces;
the cask intentionally has no destructive zap. Verify install, upgrade, and
uninstall after the exact official asset is available. Never publish a cask
computed from unsigned or unnotarized dry-run bytes.

## Single publication review

Present source/app/website/cask diffs, exact source commit/version/build, exact
notes, artifact hashes, source completeness, test results, signing/notarization
evidence, URLs, and intended actions. Report pending manual checks. Obtain
explicit publication approval before pushing source or deploying anything.

After approval:

1. Publish the sanitized GPL source, enable Issues, and verify anonymous source
   and Issues access. Tag the exact reviewed commit as `vX.Y.Z`; tags and assets
   are immutable after release.
2. Create the GitHub release with the approved `ReleaseNotes.md` contents and
   upload only `Panoptos.dmg` and the matching source archive. The body carries
   both checksums. Download both assets anonymously and compare bytes.
3. Publish the generated appcast and website only after assets are reachable.
   Verify version/build, enclosure URL/length/signature, release notes, old feed
   entries, and existing immutable download paths. Never edit signed feed data
   by hand or overwrite published binaries.
4. Publish the cask only after its GitHub DMG is public and its checksum matches.
   Keep the verified `brew install --cask ruverse/tap/panoptos` command in the
   application README.
5. Enable the verified Gumroad support link. File delivery must use the same DMG
   with matching source/GPL links; modifying the listing or its delivery requires
   explicit authorization. No real purchase is needed for testing.
6. Review legacy customer support before retiring Lemon Squeezy infrastructure.
   Keep old reset/upgrade links useful and do not revoke credentials or delete
   provider records as part of publishing source.

Report local, draft, and public state separately. A preparation artifact is not
a published release. If rollout fails, report precisely what is already live.
